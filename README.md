Fidus Writer 
===========

Fidus Writer is an online collaborative editor especially made for academics who need to use citations and/or formulas. The editor focuses on the content rather than the layout, so that with the same text, you can later on publish it in multiple ways: On a website, as a printed book, or as an ebook. In each case, you can choose from a number of layouts that are adequate for the medium of choice.

  > sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev python-dev python-virtualenv gettext

3. Cd to where you have your sources using your terminal/command line.

4. You can use the virtualenv command to create virtual environments. The following command will create an environment called "fiduswriter-venv":

  > virtualenv  --no-site-packages fiduswriter-venv

5. Activate the virtualenv by typing:

  > source fiduswriter-venv/bin/activate

### Individual pages in Chromium/Chrome:

Go to "chrome:flags" in the URL navigation bar of your browser and enable "Enable experimental Web Platform features."

  1. Install the libmysql development package. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can do this by executing:

    > sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

  2. While inside your Fidus Writer virtualenv, install the python requirements specific to MySQL:  
  
    > pip install -r mysql-requirements.txt

  3. Create a database and a user with access to it, making sure that the characterset of the database is set to UTF8. Check here http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-create-a-mysql-database-and-set-privileges-to-a-user/ for how to create a database and set up user priviliges. Make sure that when you create the database, you specify the characterset:

  4. Copy configuration.py-default to configuration.py, uncomment and fill out the section entitled "DATABASES".

### Run several instances of Fidus Writer in parallel:
 
  1. If you will be running several instances of Fidus Writer that need to communicate between each other, you will need to add redis for message exchange. Install a redis server. On Debian/Ubuntu, you need to do:
  
    > sudo apt-get install redis-server 
  
  2. While inside your Fidus Writer virtualenv, install the python requirements for redis like this:

    > pip install -r redis-requirements.txt

  3. Copy configuration.py-default to configuration.py, uncomment and fill out the section entitled "CACHES".


### Run the Fidus Writer server on an alternative port:

  Instead of starting the server with:

  > python manage.py runserver

  Specify the port number like this:

  > python manage.py runserver 9000
  
  9000 is the port number that this server listens on.
